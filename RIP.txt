in RIP every router that participates in routing sends an update message to all its neighbors once every 30 seconds. Suppose the current route for network N uses router G. If we don't hear from G for 180 seconds, we can assume that either the router has crashed or the network connecting us to it has become unusable. Thus, we mark the route as invalid.



Each router that implements RIP is assumed to have a routing table. This table has one entry for every destination that is reachable throughout the system operating RIP. Each entry contains at least the following information:
- The IPv4 address of the destination.
- A metric, which represents the total cost of getting a datagram from the router to that destination. This metric is the sum of the costs associated with the networks that would be traversed to get to the destination.
- The IPv4 address of the next router along the path to the destination (i.e., the next hop). If the destination is on one of the directly-connected networks, this item is not needed.
- A flag to indicate that information about the route has changed recently. This will be referred to as the "route change flag."
- Various timers associated with the route. See section 3.6 for more details on timers.
